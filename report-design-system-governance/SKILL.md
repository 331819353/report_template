# Report Design System Governance

## Overview

Use this skill to create, audit, merge, apply, or validate reusable report design-system standards across design, implementation, runtime QA, testing, acceptance, and handoff.

When the standard is built from user-provided component screenshots or samples, governance owns the outcome target: all reusable sample styles must become text-only, controlled, adaptive pattern contracts. The acceptance target is `100% routable coverage` of the provided sample universe, with unsupported samples recorded as `requires-pattern-extension` instead of being left as screenshots.

It governs the shared baseline. Use `$report-visual-layout-design` for a page layout fix, `$report-layout-size-constraint-spec` for block/viewport fit, `$report-component-style-design` for mixed component repair, `$report-component-design-spec` for reusable component-family standards, `$report-chart-design-spec` for charts, `$report-table-design-spec` for tables, `$report-filter-control-design-spec` for filters, `$report-component-placement-spec` for implementation-ready component coordinates, and `$report-prototype-template-management` for bundled template assets.

For Haier-branded or enterprise report/dashboard/BI/data-screen work, load `$haier-enterprise-app-ui-design-spec` as the company-level application UI baseline and keep inherited company rules separate from report-specific extensions and project exceptions. Do not treat Haier UI and report design rules as alternatives: Haier owns tokens and base application components; report governance owns analytical hierarchy, visualization, metric, chart/table/filter, and acceptance rules.

## Use Modes

| Mode | Use when | Output emphasis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `create-standard` | A team needs a reusable report design system | Tokens, layout, component, visualization, state, engineering, and governance standards |
| `audit-standard` | Existing reports or standards are inconsistent | Findings, missing rules, conflict matrix, repair priorities |
| `merge-standards` | Multiple docs/templates/skills overlap | Source-of-truth decision, merged rules, deprecated rules |
| `extend-haier-standard` | Haier UI is the company baseline, including report applications | Inherited Haier tokens/base components plus report extensions |
| `migration-plan` | Existing reports need adoption | Versioned rollout, affected components, regression baselines, exception process |

## Reference Loading

Always choose the mode and then load only the matching references.

## Anti-Laziness Gate

For non-trivial work, apply `$quality-gate-validation` `references/anti-laziness-execution-gate.md` before final output, handoff, or readiness. Do not mark the result ready while `LAZY-*` findings remain open, when available local evidence was not inspected, when owning skills were skipped, or when proof is limited to generic statements such as "checked", "optimized", "looks good", or "implemented".

## Workflow

1. Run the Preflight understanding gate before creating, auditing, merging, applying, or accepting standards. Name mode, source-of-truth hierarchy, affected surfaces, owning specialty skills, hard constraints, missing evidence, and start decision.
2. Select mode and source-of-truth hierarchy: company standard, report extension, template standard, project exception, or legacy override. For Haier/enterprise report pages, default hierarchy is `Haier company UI baseline -> report design-system extension -> template/project exception`.
3. When the user explicitly asks for modern SaaS Dashboard / BI Dashboard / UI Kit / light gray-white / white-card / linear clean style, load `references/12-modern-saas-bi-style-contract.md` and translate the wording into semantic tokens, hierarchy rules, chart-lightness rules, and `VIS-*` failure IDs.
4. Inventory design surfaces: shell, navigation, filters, KPI cards including KPI overview / multi-metric overview cards, single-indicator KPI grid cards, KPI judgment/status/health/rating/gauge cards, KPI goal execution / target attainment / gap / progress / milestone cards, KPI time-series / trend / change / YoY-MoM / cycle / volatility / forecast cards, KPI comparison analysis / comparison / group comparison / competitor / benchmark / variance cards, ranking / leaderboard / Top N / Pareto cards, composition / share / structure / market-share cards, decomposition / attribution / contribution / hierarchy cards, distribution / interval / density / quantile / boxplot cards, anomaly / risk / warning / outlier analysis cards, relationship / correlation / association / influence cards, horizontal KPI cards, axis-line diagnostic KPI cards, axis-bar diagnostic KPI cards, axis-scatter diagnostic KPI cards, spatial-map diagnostic KPI cards, and paired comparison diagnostic KPI cards, charts, tables, Composite Panels, Micro Dashboard Cards, drawers, modals, buttons, tags, empty/loading/error/no-permission/building states, export, responsive layouts, and custom graphics.
5. Classify whether the work is report/dashboard/BI/data-screen, common enterprise app, or mixed. Load Haier company UI baseline for Haier/enterprise app surfaces and report design-system references for report surfaces before judging or defining rules.
6. Run the generic anti-AI gate and report decision gate before stabilizing tokens or accepting a visual standard.
7. For sample-derived standards, run the style generalization goal: every reusable visual sample must map to controlled patterns, composed patterns, or `requires-pattern-extension`; raw images and embeddings are not durable skill knowledge.
8. Define semantic tokens and reusable rules: color roles, typography, spacing/grid, radius, border, shadow, density, icon size, z-index, responsive breakpoints, states, accessibility, motion limits, modern BI page/card language, and chart-lightness defaults.
9. Define page, component, visualization, numeric precision/display, filter, state, performance, and handoff standards. Delegate numeric display details to `$metric-number-display-contract`; delegate implementation-ready component families to `$report-component-design-spec` and `$report-component-style-design`.
10. Classify rule strength before acceptance: `MUST/fail` for correctness/trust/runtime/renderer/filter/permission/export/accessibility/readiness constraints, `SHOULD/exception-required` for strong defaults that may vary by business scenario, and `MAY/optional` for enhancements. Every `MUST` gets a proof method and failure ID; every `SHOULD` gets an exception condition.
11. Define governance: stable vs experimental rules, allowed variants, deprecated patterns, exception process, versioning, migration status, owners, and review checklist.
12. Route implementation or remediation to layout, component, frontend, runtime QA, testing, or template skills.

## Required Output

- Preflight understanding result, mode, source-of-truth hierarchy, input inventory, and scope.
- Inherited Haier baseline decisions for color, typography, spacing, radius, shadow, icon/base component, brand/logo, state, and cross-platform behavior.
- Token, page-layout, component, visualization, numeric precision/display, filter, state, accessibility, interaction, and performance standards.
- Modern SaaS / BI Dashboard / UI Kit style contract result when requested: selected source hierarchy, page/card tokens, hierarchy rules, chart-lightness rules, and open `VIS-*` findings.
- Sample-derived style generalization coverage: controlled pattern fields, covered/composed/extension statuses, non-retained image policy, and text-only reproducibility result.
- Report guideline mapping: requirements, metric dictionary, calculation口径, page hierarchy, chart/table/filter/state rules, engineering handoff, and acceptance checklist.
- Anti-AI and report-decision gate result with `AI-*` and `RPT-*` findings or explicit pass status.
- Rule strength matrix: `MUST/fail`, `SHOULD/exception-required`, and `MAY/optional` rules, with proof method, failure ID, and allowed exception condition for any advisory wording.
- Governance matrix: version, owner/source, status, allowed variants, deprecated patterns, exception approval, migration impact, and review checklist.
- Adoption or remediation plan with affected projects/components and regression evidence requirements.

## Quality Gate

- Do not output an empty table-only template; each required rule needs values, inherited source references, or explicit `gap` status.
- Do not create, audit, merge, or accept a report design-system standard before source-of-truth hierarchy, affected surfaces, and specialty skill ownership are clear.
- Do not accept a Haier/enterprise report standard that omits inherited Haier color, typography, spacing, radius, shadow, base control, brand/logo, state, and responsive rules.
- Do not create one-off colors, spacings, hover effects, chart semantics, or component variants without semantic tokens or approved exceptions.
- Do not accept generic "modern SaaS", "高级科技感", purple-blue gradients, glass cards, glow buttons, floating decoration, oversized radius, or abstract AI imagery as default report style.
- When the user explicitly requests modern SaaS / BI Dashboard / UI Kit language, do not leave it as a generic adjective. It must map to `12-modern-saas-bi-style-contract.md`; missing page/card token mapping, flat hierarchy, component pileup, or overweight charts block readiness with the contract `VIS-*` IDs.
- Reusable standards must cover responsive behavior, edge states, accessibility, data density, numeric display contracts, exact-value access, engineering tokens, and migration impact.
- Reusable screenshot/sample-derived standards must reach `100% routable coverage` for the provided sample set: every reusable sample is covered by existing patterns, composed patterns, or a named extension gap, and no long-lived standard depends on raw image paths, image embeddings, or OCR-only extraction.
- Reusable standards must not leave high-risk rules as vague advice. Renderer ownership, filter scope, query/export/permission impact, data contracts, runtime fit, overflow, accessibility, and readiness evidence must be written as `MUST/fail` with proof obligations.
- Report standards must preserve metric口径, metric tree/driver path, realistic data states, drilldown/detail/action, trust metadata, and industry vocabulary.
- Load `10-design-system-acceptance-gates.md` before accepting a reusable standard, audit result, merge, or migration plan.
