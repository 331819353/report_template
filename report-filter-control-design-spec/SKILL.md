# Report Filter Control Design Spec

## Positioning

Use this as the direct front door for filter-control standards. It separates filter design from filter testing and API implementation.

When filter controls come from screenshots or visual samples, treat them as part of the same component-style generalization target: every reusable selector must become a text-only `filterControlPattern` contract with size tiers, scope, data binding, states, and fallback. Do not rely on the original image or vector embedding as durable knowledge.

Use `$filter-linkage-completeness-test` when the task is runtime testing; use this skill when designing or reviewing filter control semantics, visual placement, local/global scope, defaults, reset, cascade, and component ownership.

## Anti-Laziness Gate

For non-trivial work, apply `$quality-gate-validation` `references/anti-laziness-execution-gate.md` before final output, handoff, or readiness. Do not mark the result ready while `LAZY-*` findings remain open, when available local evidence was not inspected, when owning skills were skipped, or when proof is limited to generic statements such as "checked", "optimized", "looks good", or "implemented".

## Workflow

1. Run the Preflight understanding gate for implementation, repair, or acceptance work; name filter scope candidates, option/data authority, affected components, query/export/pagination impact, hard constraints, missing evidence, and start decision.
2. For sample-derived filter visuals, run the style generalization target and map each sample to `filterControlPattern`, a composed filter surface, or a documented extension gap.
3. Classify each control as page/global, module/tab scoped, component-local, or table-column scoped.
4. Define option source, default value, reset behavior, cascade rule, permission-limited options, empty/no-permission state, and backend/query ownership.
5. Select a stable `filterControlPattern` when the visual expression matters, such as single select, multi-tag select, date range, searchable select, tree path, advanced drawer, or combined chipbar.
6. Place page/global filters in the page shell or template-native filter surface; place component-local filters in the component header/title-right area.
7. Check whether filter changes affect metrics, chart series, table rows, export scope, pagination, drilldown, and cache/query context.
8. Convert filter rules into proof obligations when implementation or URL exists: option-source evidence, default/non-default/reset/cascade state, query/API/provider params, export/pagination/drilldown context, template/component control ownership, and screenshot/DOM evidence for placement.
9. Hand off testing cases to `$filter-linkage-completeness-test` when runtime verification is needed.

## Required Output

- Preflight understanding result when the work is implementation/repair/acceptance, plus filter scope and ownership matrix.
- Control type, default/reset/cascade behavior, option source, and query/API impact.
- Selected `filterControlPattern`, size tier behavior, active summary, and state rules when visual filter design is in scope.
- Sample-derived generalization status: selected `filterControlPattern`, adaptive size variables, fallback, and text-only reproducibility.
- Placement rules for page/global and component-local controls.
- Proof obligations: scope classification, option-source evidence, default/non-default/reset/cascade states, query/export/pagination/drilldown impact, template-native surface or component-local ownership, and runtime handoff checks.
- Runtime test handoff items when behavior must be verified.

## Quality Gate

- Do not hide a perspective switch or schema-changing view switch as an ordinary filter.
- Do not design, repair, or accept filters before filter scope, option source, default/reset behavior, and affected component/query contracts are known.
- Component-local filters cannot silently change page/global scope, export scope, backend aggregation, or other components.
- Filter controls are not ready until default, non-default, empty, no-permission, reset, and cascade states are defined or explicitly blocked.
- Screenshot-inspired filter controls must be converted into text/structured filter selector contracts; do not rely on raw screenshots as durable guidance.
- Sample-derived filter controls are not ready unless each reusable selector maps to `filterControlPattern`, a composed filter surface, or a documented `requires-pattern-extension` gap under the shared style generalization goal.
- Template-based pages must not duplicate page/global filter surfaces. Page/global filters belong in the template-native filter trigger/panel/popover/drawer or a named redesign exception; component-local filters must prove current-component scope.
- Advisory filter wording is not enough for readiness. Scope, source, default/reset/cascade, query/API impact, export/pagination/drilldown context, and permission behavior are `MUST/fail` constraints with proof obligations.
