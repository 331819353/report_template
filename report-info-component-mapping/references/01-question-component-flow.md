# 01 Question Component Flow

Use this reference when deciding how a business question becomes answer atoms, content blocks, and real components.

Before this step, classify the request with `00-analysis-perspective-card-taxonomy.md` when the user uses viewing intents such as 看现状, 看目标, 看趋势, 看排名, 看原因, 看行动, 看质量, or 看明细. The perspective is the stable routing layer; answer atoms and component bundles are the implementation layer.

## Cognitive Task Mapping

- Judge current status: KPI judgment card with status/score/threshold/range semantics, KPI card, health badge, target card, bullet chart.
- Compare values: KPI comparison analysis card with `kpiComparisonAnalysisCardPattern` for compact direct/group/competitor/benchmark/variance comparison; otherwise comparison bar, grouped bar, bullet chart, side-by-side table.
- Read scale with rate/target together: Combo chart with bar for amount/count/scale and line or target/reference for rate/trend/efficiency/standard.
- Rank objects: ranking/leaderboard/Top N card with `rankingCardPattern`, horizontal bar, ranking table, Top/Bottom list.
- See time movement: line chart, area chart, sparkline, annotated trend.
- Locate risky or important objects: heatmap, matrix, map, Top N list, alert table.
- Cross-summarize dimensions: Pivot Table with row dimensions, column dimensions, measures, aggregation formulas, subtotal/grand-total rules, frozen row headers, exact cell tooltip, and drilldown to detail evidence.
- Read grouped table fields: grouped table header with business column groups, `columnTree`, computed `colSpan`/`rowSpan`, leaf units/definitions, fixed multi-level header, and frozen row/primary columns when horizontal scroll exists.
- Complete a mini analysis loop inside one container: Composite Panel with one shared topic, one primary child, summary -> trend/structure -> contribution/exception -> detail/action sequence, panel-level local filter, shared legend/unit, and linked child interaction.
- Explain a decision point: Analysis & Insight component with one subtype, one main conclusion, supporting evidence, affected object, action or trust context, and `analysisInsightContract`.
- Compare multi-metric object profiles: parallel coordinates with object/dimension/axis contracts, plus detail table for exact values.
- Explain why: waterfall, decomposition tree, funnel/process chart, contribution analysis.
- Trace source-to-target flow: Sankey with node/link schema, Top N aggregation, main-flow highlight, and exact link tooltip/detail.
- Inspect exact records: table, drawer, source link, export.
- Inspect row-level records: Detail Table with stable primary key, default sort, pagination/search/export scope, row detail drawer, and exact hidden-field disclosure.
- Execute actions: task card, Kanban, workflow stepper, operation buttons.
- Prove data correctness: source comparison, lineage, version list, operation log.
- Present a story: conclusion cards, chapter blocks, timeline, action plan table.

## Component Selection Constraints

- A component is valid only when it answers a named business question.
- In sample/source restoration, a visible source module is not automatically `must-have`. Classify each source module as:
  - `businessRequired`: directly answers the user's stated report question.
  - `sampleStructure`: needed to preserve the sample's shell, hierarchy, or module rhythm, but not a business-required component.
  - `optionalEnhancement`: useful extra capability that should be labeled and must not alter the sample's first viewport or main body layout.
- Two components may show the same metric only when they answer different tasks, such as current value and trend.
- KPI cards must include actual value, unit, period, comparison baseline, direction, and status rule when judgment is implied.
- KPI Overview Cards are valid when one container answers one domain overview question, such as 销售总览, 用户增长总览, 运营指标总览, or 财务总览, through `2-5` related metrics. They must declare `kpiOverviewCardPattern`, `overviewTopic`, lead metric when present, metric cell list, local control scope, exact-value/detail route, and the `kpi_overview_card` size family. If the metrics are independent questions, split them into separate KPI cards or a Micro Dashboard Card.
- KPI Judgment Cards are valid when one metric/card answers status, health, score, rating, risk, progress, or gauge judgment. They must declare `kpiJudgmentCardPattern`, `judgmentKind`, status/score field, range or dictionary, threshold/band fields when visible, business direction, comparison strip fields, footer evidence/source path, and the `kpi_judgment_card` size family. If the requirement is an empty/error/no-permission condition, use `state-feedback`; if the requirement is a full range visualization with axes or many objects, use a chart/table instead.
- KPI Goal Execution Cards are valid when one metric/card answers target attainment, target gap, plan-vs-actual progress, remaining work, deadline, or milestone state. They must declare `kpiGoalExecutionCardPattern`, `goalExecutionKind`, actual/target fields, required attainment/gap/progress/milestone fields, formula/denominator and direction semantics, comparison strip fields, deadline/remaining-time fields when visible, footer evidence/source path, and the `kpi_goal_execution_card` size family. If many objects or many stages must be compared, split to a full chart/table/timeline/Gantt block instead.
- KPI Time-Series Cards are valid when one metric/card answers trend movement, named-baseline change, YoY/MoM comparison, cycle/period state, volatility/stability, or forecast uncertainty. They must declare `kpiTimeSeriesCardPattern`, `temporalAnalysisKind`, ordered x/y fields, grain, latest period, direction semantics, selected-pattern baseline/cycle/volatility/forecast fields, tooltip payload, footer evidence/source path, and the `kpi_time_series_card` size family. If the main task is multi-series comparison, dense trend audit, or exact forecast review, split to a full chart/table instead.
- KPI Comparison Analysis Cards are valid when one metric/card answers direct comparison, group/segment comparison, competitor position, benchmark distance, or variance/gap diagnosis. They must declare `kpiComparisonAnalysisCardPattern`, `kpiComparisonAnalysisEvidenceMode`, `comparisonAnalysisKind`, comparable subject grain/roles, shared metric definition, unit, period/grain, filter scope, direction semantics, benchmark or variance fields when required, deterministic sort/visible limit, footer evidence/source path, and the `kpi_comparison_analysis_card` size family. If the comparison needs many objects, many dimensions, or exact audit, split to a full chart/table/map block instead.
- Trend charts require consistent time grain.
- Combo charts require one shared ordered category/time grain, a named scale-to-rate/target business relationship, declared bar metric/unit, line or target metric/unit, left/right y-axis mapping, total visible series `<=4`, tooltip exact values, and split-chart fallback. Use separate bar/line/table views when the metrics are unrelated, dual-axis semantics are weak, category labels are dense, or exact audit is the main task.
- Detail Tables require row grain, row id/primary key, visible column priority, default sort, column type/width/alignment, status/action semantics, pagination/search/sort/export scope, and row detail/action payload. Use Detail Tables for lookup, audit, reconciliation, export, and row action; do not use them as unprioritized source-table dumps or show checkbox/action columns without a real batch/action flow.
- Tables with more than `8` visible columns or natural field groups require a grouped-header contract: business group nodes, leaf fields, units/definitions, computed `colSpan`/`rowSpan`, max depth `<=3` by default, fixed multi-level header, frozen row/primary columns when scrolling, and component-local filters separated from per-column header filters. A flat header needs an explicit reason.
- Multiple child components may become a Composite Panel only when they answer one shared business question and can declare `compositePanelContract`: topic, analysis sequence, primary child, child roles/priorities/min sizes, default `2-3` children and max `4`, primary visual weight `50-70%`, shared panel-level filter, shared legend/unit, linked interaction, detail-preview limit, responsive fallback, and parent/child states. If children have independent questions or independent full controls, split them into separate parent blocks.
- Analysis & Insight components are valid only when they explain a concrete decision point: conclusion, insight, anomaly, attribution, impact factor, comparison, trend interpretation, target diagnosis, recommendation, risk, definition, data quality, forecast, annotation, state, or task. They require `analysisInsightContract` and cannot be generic narrative copy. If the component cannot show evidence, action/trust, source/freshness, or an insufficient-data state, it is decorative.
- Ranking / leaderboard / Top N cards are valid only when row or slot order is the answer. They must declare `rankingCardPattern`, `rankingEvidenceBinding`, ranking mode, source-side Top N or bounded-local exception, object id/name fields, metric/unit, value/rank/tie-break fields, visible budget, overflow/detail path, and exact-value tooltip. Use a detail table or operational list when row order is not magnitude, score, contribution, target progress, or priority.
- Pareto cards are valid only when the metric is additive and sorted descending with a meaningful cumulative threshold. They must declare `paretoCardPattern`, `paretoEvidenceBinding`, additive value, total, contribution share, cumulative value/share, threshold boundary, boundary/key-factor flag, and long-tail policy. Use ordinary ranking, waterfall, decomposition tree, or table when cumulative contribution is not valid evidence.
- Funnel charts require ordered stages, shared population or documented cohort logic, value/unit, entry share, stage conversion, drop value/rate, total conversion, stage-count fallback, and exact tooltip/detail. Use funnel only for stage retention/conversion/loss questions; use bar/table for unordered stage comparison, line for trend, path for explicit movement paths, and Sankey for multi-branch source-target flows.
- Waterfall charts require additive contribution logic. Non-additive drivers need contribution bars, driver tables, decomposition trees, or narrative explanation.
- Pie/donut charts are not the default. Use only for very small part-to-whole composition with clear labels.
- Sankey diagrams are valid only for source-to-target flow, allocation, transfer, conversion, loss, or many-stage distribution tasks. Require node schema, directed links with `source`/`target`/`value`, layer/stage order, metric unit, Top N/`其他`, node/link density limits, flow-width semantics, legend/filter separation, exact node/link tooltip/detail, and fallback to table/path/funnel/bar when there is no real flow, only ranking/composition, negative values, or dense all-link clutter.
- Treemap/rectangular tree maps are valid only for hierarchical composition and scale/share reading with a non-negative additive area metric, Top N/`其他`, label thresholds, color semantics, and exact path/value/share tooltip. Use tree for expand/collapse hierarchy and bar/table for precise ranking or negative values.
- Sunburst charts are valid only for hierarchy path plus composition share with a non-negative additive angle metric, visible depth/ring budget, Top N/`其他`, sector label thresholds, center content, breadcrumb/drilldown, and exact full-path/value/total-share/parent-share tooltip. Use Treemap for area-size comparison, tree for expansion context, and bar/table for precise ranking, trend, negative values, or single-level composition.
- Parallel coordinates are valid only for multi-metric object profiles with `3+` metric dimensions. Require object/sample id, `3-12` ordered dimension fields, axis unit/range/direction, independent or standardized scale, sample-density opacity/sampling, Top/anomaly/selected highlight, exact object tooltip/detail, and fallback to table, scatter, bar, filtering, or horizontal scroll when dimensions/samples exceed readability.
- Maps are valid only when geography itself matters.
- Gauges are valid only for a single bounded progress/status metric with min/max range, unit, current value, target/threshold/status semantics when present, and exact tooltip/detail. Use KPI/progress bar when only the number matters, bar/table for multi-object comparison, line for trend, and table/detail for exact audit.
- Dense analytical tables, pivot tables, cross tables, and wide metric matrices should use AntV S2.
- Simple operation lists, alerts, task lists, short forms, pagination, tags, popovers, dialogs, drawers, and basic data tables should use Element Plus in Vue report prototypes unless the existing project design system supersedes it.
- Large graphs such as lineage, decomposition, process network, DuPont, Gantt, or map need a viewport with zoom, pan, reset, and fullscreen.
- For status-overview reports, process/path/flow diagrams are secondary. Use them only when the core question explicitly asks for value chain, dependency, lineage, transmission, process conversion, or flow attribution; otherwise prefer KPI, target/variance, trend, structure, ranking, or risk-entry components.

## Multi-Component Constraints

- Define one primary component or primary KPI group. The rest must be supporting, evidence, or action components.
- First viewport should usually contain 3-7 meaningful components, not a crowded catalogue.
- Every component must have a different semantic role, dimension, grain, or workflow purpose.
- If two components answer the same sub-question, merge them or keep the more precise one.
- Put judgment before evidence unless the report is detail-query or reconciliation-first.
- Put action entries near the object they act on: alert row, task row, risk card, or detail drawer.
- Keep all components under the same global filter context unless the difference is intentional and labeled.
- Do not add a chart when a single KPI, table, or text-summary answers the question better.
- Use Pivot Table only when the business question is a multidimensional aggregated cross-summary. It must include row dimensions, column dimensions, measures, aggregation functions/formulas, subtotal/grand-total rules, density fallback, and drilldown/tooltip evidence; raw records stay in Detail Tables.

## Adaptive Rules

- Infer business purpose from verbs such as "看整体", "为什么", "查明细", "谁好谁差", "汇报", "异常", "执行", "核对", "流失", "转化", "达成", "偏差".
- Start with fewer, stronger blocks rather than a crowded page.
- Mark assumptions and list the minimum missing fields needed to finalize.
- If a component choice depends on data shape, state the condition clearly. Example: "有阶段顺序时用漏斗, 否则用结构柱状图".
