# Report Visual Layout Design

## Positioning

Use this skill for report page-level layout: shell, navigation, header/filter/control surface, toolbar, brand placement, `8 * N` grid, parent-block sizing, internal sub-block composition, first-viewport hierarchy, responsive behavior, and layout defect repair.

It owns page规范. Component internals go to `$report-component-style-design`; reusable component standards go to `$report-component-design-spec`; full design-system governance goes to `$report-design-system-governance`; runnable templates go to `$report-prototype-template-management`.

For Haier/enterprise Web surfaces, including report/dashboard/BI/data-screen layouts, load `$haier-enterprise-app-ui-design-spec` for company-level color, typography, spacing, base controls, states, and brand/logo rules. Also load `$report-design-system-governance` report guideline references before final report layout decisions. These baselines are inherited together; they are not alternatives.

## Anti-Laziness Gate

For non-trivial work, apply `$quality-gate-validation` `references/anti-laziness-execution-gate.md` before final output, handoff, or readiness. Do not mark the result ready while `LAZY-*` findings remain open, when available local evidence was not inspected, when owning skills were skipped, or when proof is limited to generic statements such as "checked", "optimized", "looks good", or "implemented".

## Workflow

1. Run the Preflight understanding gate for implementation, repair, or acceptance work; name page purpose, baseline, affected surfaces, specialty skill routing, hard constraints, missing evidence, and start decision.
2. Identify page purpose, user, primary report question, density, display scenario, first action, and target viewport.
3. Classify the baseline: report/dashboard, common enterprise app, template-based page, custom page, or mixed. For Haier/enterprise report pages, record both the inherited Haier application baseline and report-specific baseline.
4. If modern SaaS / BI Dashboard / UI Kit style is requested, apply the positive style contract to the page canvas, card hierarchy, first-viewport priority, component count, and chart-lightness layout checks.
5. Run anti-AI and report-decision layout checks when the page is a report surface.
6. Choose shell structure: topbar, left-nav, unified header/control area, fixed cockpit, existing shell, or custom shell.
7. Place navigation, page/global filters, toolbar actions, brand/logo, refresh/export/fullscreen/status controls, and template-native filter entry when applicable.
8. Plan the first meaningful viewport and downstream reading path.
9. Lay out top-level parent blocks in legal `8 * N` spans, then decide whether each block contains one component or composed internal sub-blocks.
10. Size blocks and sub-blocks from content needs: KPI, summary, chart, table, complex diagram, task list, evidence panel, drawer/detail, or action area. Use `$report-layout-size-constraint-spec` when the task is mainly block size, height budget, overflow, or viewport fit.
11. Define layout states and responsive fallback for parent blocks and sub-blocks.
12. Use `layout-acceptance-gates.md` before accepting implementation-ready layout or repairing overlap/cropping defects.

## Required Output

- Preflight understanding result when the work is implementation/repair/acceptance, plus surface classification, baseline inheritance references, and shell choice.
- First-viewport hierarchy and reading path.
- Header/navigation/filter/toolbar/brand structure.
- Modern BI page-language plan when requested: light page canvas, white-card block surfaces, no nested-card strategy, first-viewport hierarchy, component-count rationale, and chart-lightness layout implications.
- `8 * N` parent-block grid and internal sub-block plan.
- Block sizing rationale, state plan, responsive plan, and downstream component/template handoffs.
- Proof obligations for implementation-ready layout: legal grid spans, filter/control ownership, fixed-height overflow checks, first-viewport answer, component handoff, screenshot/DOM evidence, and exception conditions for advisory layout defaults.
- Layout risks, `DESIGN-*`/`RPT-*`/`VIS-*` findings, and readiness: `ready`, `partial`, or `blocked`.

## Quality Gate

- The first meaningful viewport must answer the page's main question or expose the main action.
- Do not repair or accept page layout before affected component families and their chart/table/filter/placement owners are identified.
- Do not accept Haier/enterprise report layout that applies report grid rules but omits Haier application typography, color, spacing, base surface, and brand/logo constraints.
- Layout must be driven by task, data density, business priority, state coverage, and next action, not decorative polish.
- A requested modern SaaS / BI Dashboard / UI Kit layout is not ready unless light page/card styling, clear information hierarchy, no component pileup, and lightweight chart allocation are proven or recorded as `VIS-*` findings.
- Report pages must expose metric tree, diagnostic path, detail/action route, and trust/source/version placement or explicit scoped gaps.
- Template-native filter surfaces must be reused unless a template-level redesign is explicitly requested.
- Fixed-height navigation/cards/KPI strips need padding, explicit line-height, gap, and DOM overflow checks at `1920x1080` and `1280x768` using `scrollHeight <= clientHeight + 2` and `scrollWidth <= clientWidth + 2`, or a declared visible scroll/disclosure strategy.
- Layout defaults such as block composition, first-level navigation density, and template filter reuse are not optional polish when they affect readability, clipping, or shell consistency. Treat them as `MUST/fail` unless an explicit business/template exception and proof are recorded.
- Dense tables/charts/diagrams need enough block area or a scroll/fullscreen/drawer/fallback strategy.
- Page layout cannot hide an axis-chart, KPI-card, ranking-card, Pareto-card, composition-card, decomposition-card, or distribution-card squeeze inside a valid grid span. Full line/bar/combo blocks, KPI overview cards, single-indicator KPI cards, KPI judgment cards, KPI goal execution cards, ranking / leaderboard / Top N cards, Pareto cards, composition / share / structure cards, decomposition / attribution / contribution / hierarchy cards, distribution / interval / density / quantile / boxplot cards, and axis-line/axis-bar/axis-scatter/spatial-map/paired-comparison diagnostic KPI cards must reserve their component-family value, evidence, footer, hero visual, execution visual, row/list, cumulative chart, denominator/detail, explanation body, formula/node/link/stage/matrix area, statistical body, sample/statistic strip, plot, map, metric-cell, or pane floors; chart + table/list blocks must prove both chart readability and at least `3` preview rows. If the grid span cannot carry both, enlarge/split the block or move detail to drawer/tab/detail before accepting the layout.
- Load `layout-acceptance-gates.md` before marking a layout ready for implementation or acceptance.
